# my_KAYTRANADA_mix1

# Project Name
> My KAYTRANADA mix blends two songs by the Canadian rapper, singer and DJ - KAYTRANADA, who inspired me to make this project. The project was made on the TunePad platform using Python coding languague where i emulated KAYTRANADA's signature sound and added some original flair
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## General Information

My project is a prototype of a song in a House x R&B style. The reason why I chose to embark on this artistic challenge is because I want to push myself beyond my comfort zone since I have never created music before, and I want to use this opportunity to experiment with different sounds, rhythms and genres of music. I chose KAYTRANADA as inspiration because I like how he blends a lot of different genres together - electronic, hip-hop, house, R&B to name a few. His innovative style has influenced me to try and come up with something similar of my own. From this artistic challenge, I hope I can advance my music coding skills by making smooth, cohesive songs whilst experimenting with rhythm, layering and genre fusion.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_. I would like to continue adding to this project in the future.

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- It is only a short song so add more to it
- Doesn't have very advanced coding

To do:
-  Experiment more with rhythm 
-  Add more KAYTRANADA sample songs
